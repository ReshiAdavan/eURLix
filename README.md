# eURLix

Dont mind me, just learning a new language through creating a project.

Behold, a URL Shortener in Elixir, Phoenix, and Mnesia

## Starting

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
